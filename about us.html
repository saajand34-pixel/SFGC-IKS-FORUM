            <p>The Seshadripuram Educational Trust (SET) stands as a landmark of academic heritage in Karnataka, tracing its origins back to a modest primary school founded in 1930 by two visionary women, Smt. Anandamma and Smt. Seethamma. Over nearly a century, it has grown from a tiny two-room setup into a sprawling network of 34 institutions that serve approximately 24,500 students from kindergarten through to doctoral research. Headquartered in Bengaluru, the Trust operates on the democratic principle of being "by the people, for the people," prioritizing affordable, high-quality education for all socio-economic backgrounds.

Beyond its impressive scale, SET is distinguished by its commitment to holistic development and global standards. Its institutions—ranging from prestigious commerce colleges to law schools and postgraduate centers—are supported by a dedicated faculty of over 1,500 staff members. The Trust has earned significant accolades, including the National Award for the Best NSS Unit, and maintains international collaborations with universities across the UK, USA, and Europe to ensure its students are globally competitive. By blending modern infrastructure with a deep-rooted sense of social responsibility, SET continues to be a driving force in shaping the intellectual and moral fabric of the nation.</p>

            <h2>IQAC (Internal Quality Assurance Cell)</h2>
            <p>The Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) of S.F.G.C is a task force comprising senior faculty members dedicated to maintaining and enhancing the quality of the institution. The primary mission of the IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent, and catalytic improvement in quality and overall performance. It aims to make a significant and meaningful contribution towards academic excellence by formulating effective intervention strategies to enhance institutional performance. The IQAC works to optimize and integrate modern methods of teaching and learning, while also disseminating information on quality parameters and sharing research insights with other institutions. The cell is chaired by the Principal and includes members of the Trust and Heads of Departments as its core members. Since quality assurance and enhancement is an ongoing process, the IQAC regularly organizes workshops and seminars on quality-related themes. Additionally, the various academic and institutional programs have been systematically documented in the form of a Self-Study Report. At present, the IQAC is prepared to welcome an expert team for assessment and accreditation under the auspices of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), a statutory body of the University Grants Commission (UGC).</p>

            <h2>About AICTE</h2>
            <img src="45368.png" alt="AICTE Logo" width="160">
            <p>The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is India’s premier statutory body responsible for the strategic planning, regulation, and quality enhancement of the technical education system. Established in 1945 and later granted statutory status in 1987, it operates under the Ministry of Education to ensure that institutions offering programs in engineering, management, pharmacy, and architecture adhere to rigorous national standards.
In 2026, AICTE has evolved beyond its traditional regulatory role to become a central "facilitator" of the Viksit Bharat @ 2047 vision, focusing heavily on industry-readiness and digital transformation. Key modern initiatives include the Project PRACTICE, which targets pedagogical reforms in 1,000 tier-2 and tier-3 colleges, and the mandatory integration of Artificial Intelligence across all engineering disciplines to ensure graduates are proficient in domain-specific AI applications. By managing national portals for internships, research fellowships, and the APAAR digital identity system, AICTE creates a unified ecosystem that bridges the gap between academic theory and global industrial requirements.</p>

            <h2>Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)</h2>
            <img src="45352.png" alt="IKS Logo" width="180">
            <p>The Indian Knowledge System (IKS) is a sophisticated and holistic framework of indigenous knowledge that has evolved over millennia, seamlessly blending the spiritual with the scientific. Unlike fragmented modern disciplines, IKS approaches subjects like mathematics, metallurgy, linguistics, and medicine as interconnected parts of a larger cosmic order. From the pioneering concept of zero and the decimal system to the surgical precision found in the Sushruta Samhita, these traditions emphasize empirical observation rooted in a sustainable worldview. By integrating ancient wisdom—such as the grammatical logic of Panini or the ecological harmony of traditional water harvesting—with contemporary needs, IKS offers a unique "Indian way" to solve global challenges like mental health and climate change.
A Modern Resurgence
Today, IKS is transitioning from historical texts to classroom curriculum through the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This movement aims to foster a "decolonized mind," encouraging students to apply traditional ethical frameworks and logic to modern fields like AI, sustainable architecture, and holistic wellness.</p>
